We came to know about Dr.Bhamri from my colleague's great experience with him so we went there and we were treated with utmost promptness by Dr.Bhamri's staff. Major obstruction was found on both of the sides during angiography which was to be treated urgently & on priority as noticed by me as well. It was a life threatening condition & i still get scared while thinking about it.
        I am thankful to Dr.Bhamri & his team as because of their expertise in the field they were able to normalize the condition & gave the joy back to us.`
